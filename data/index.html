h1. Welcome!

Welcome to your brand new Borg installation!

This file (index.html) should contain the welcome message presented to your users when they arrive on your site homepage.
Keep it short (or leave it completely empty if you don't need it) since borg will fill the rest of your
homepage with blog contents.

Once you logged in, you can edit any page by accessing the @edit/path/to/yourpage.html@ url (for example, @edit/index.html@ to edit this page).

Borg expects site contents to be organized according to this directory structure:
<pre><code>
  ['data' directory root, as configured in your borg config file]
  |
  |_ toolbar.html : main site toolbar
  |_ sidebar.html : main site sidebar
  |_ editbar.html : sidebar contents to be shown as help while editing a page
  |

  Blog contents are organized by year, month, day. For example, a blog post
  for April 25th, 2011, will be stored as 2011/04/25/blogpost.html.
  
  |
  |_ [year]
  |  |_ [month]
  |     |_ [day]
  |        |_ page.html
  |

  Other pages are stored in a hierarchical structure of your choice:

  |
  |_ projects/
  |  |_ project_one.html
  |  |_ secret_ones/
  |     |_ secret_project.html
  |
  |_ hobbies/
     |_ myhobbies.html

</code></pre>

Both sidebars and toolbars can be organized hierarchially. This means that if you create a @sidebar.html@ file
in @projects/secret_ones/@, then all pages living under that directory will use such sidebar instead of the main
site sidebar.
